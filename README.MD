WHO Life Expectancy Analysis – Power BI Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes global life expectancy trends using WHO data to identify how economic and healthcare factors influence longevity across countries and over time.
The dashboard is designed for monitoring, comparison, and insight discovery using interactive Power BI visuals.


🎯 Objectives

Track overall life expectancy using executive-level KPIs

Analyze the influence of GDP per capita, vaccination coverage, and health expenditure

Compare trends across countries and years

Enable data-driven insights through interactive filtering

📊 Dataset Description

This dataset contains country-level life expectancy data along with key health, economic, and demographic indicators for multiple years (2000–2015).
It covers 193 countries, enabling comprehensive global and temporal analysis.

The dataset is widely used for public health analytics and predictive modeling, making it suitable for exploratory analysis and dashboarding.




🧾 Key Features in the Dataset

Life Expectancy (target variable)

Country

Year

GDP

Population

Health Expenditure

Vaccination-related indicators (Polio, Diphtheria, Hepatitis B, etc.)

Adult Mortality

Infant Deaths

Status (Developed / Developing)



🛠 How the Dataset Was Prepared

The original dataset was aggregated and curated on Kaggle using data from:

World Health Organization (WHO)

World Bank development indicators

For this project, the following data preparation steps were performed in Power BI:

Cleaned and validated missing or inconsistent values

Standardized numeric columns for accurate calculations

Created derived metrics using DAX, including:

GDP per Capita

Vaccination Index (composite measure from multiple immunization indicators)

Health Expenditure Metrics

Modeled relationships to enable country-wise and year-wise analysis

Optimized data for KPI reporting and interactive visual exploration



📈 Purpose of the Dataset in This Project

The dataset is used to:

Analyze global life expectancy trends

Study the relationship between economic growth, healthcare investment, and vaccination coverage

Identify disparities in life expectancy across countries and regions

Support data-driven storytelling through Power BI dashboards


📈 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to convert complex public health data into actionable insights through effective dashboard design, analytical thinking, and storytelling.
